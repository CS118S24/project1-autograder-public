# CS118 Project 1 Public Autograder

The **only goal** of public autograder is to help you **verify** whether your code works with the private autograder on Gradescope.
The result returned by the public autograder does not indicate your final grade.
We only accept grades from our private autograder on Gradescope.

## Usage
```
(Put your files under the autograder/submission folder)
sh run_autograder
```
